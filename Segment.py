"""
    Segment.py contains all the logic regarding the creation of segments, their inintializaiton, and the 
     picking of tracks according to the segment's behavior/type.
    
    For ease of use, buildSegment() is used. Simply plop in the parent directory (typically "stations/[stationName]/dj/"), the 
     segmentDataDictionary (read from the JSON file by the DynamicStation object, passed through the DJ object), and it'll return
     the appropriate Segment Object to suit your needs. If segmentType doesn't fit or doesn't exist, it'll return a blank segment
     with no tracks while logging an error.
    
    Different Segment types are kind-of similar to the basic Station logic, minus the Update() functions. These run once, generating
     and returning their tracks and the track durations in a list of dicts or None. If it's none, that means the segment doesn't wanna
     run that time, and you should respect it. If it has elements, please merge it into whatever parent list of tracks you've got going on. 
     
    Station Types:
     - Segment:
       - This is a dummy object, just logs an error every time it is called to generate a track
     - PickSegment:
       - Very similar to a pick station, where it picks a track at random. This doesn't have the same logic to prevent repeats, but
         repeats should be much less noticable (and likely) with segments
     - CountPickSegment:
       - This is a pick segment that will return between min and max tracks, useful if you want a segment to run more than once but want
         a little bit of variety in your life
     - ChancePickSegment:
       - This is a pick segment that will only play segmentRarity percent of the time, stored as a float between 1.0 and 0.0. 1.0 is 100%
         of the time. 0.5 is 50% of the time, 0.0 is 0%, etc. Useful if you don't want something to run every time.
     - DynamicSegment:
       - This guy is like a really great dad. He raises all of his children (initialization), tells them to do their homework (generateTrack),
         and puts it all together to show the world (also in generateTrack). Can be nested within each other.
     - DynamicPickSegment:
       - Like a bad dad version of DynamicSegment. Raises all the children, yes, but only showcases the work of one child when asked.
